// // 3 Create an array called egFamily and add "Julia", "James", and your name to the array. Then, print the egFamily to the console using console.log.

// //7 Define two variables called thingOne and thingTwo and assign them values. Print the values of both variables in one console.log statement using concatenation. For example,
// // red blue
// // where "red" is the value of thingOne and "blue" is the value of thingTwo. Don't forget to use semicolon at the end of each statement!
// // Your Code:

//  //8 Create a variable called fullName and assign it your full name as a string
// // Create a variable called age and addign it your age.
// // Create a varaibel called quote and assign your favorite quote as a string. 
// // Print out the results

var fullName = "Aaron Menocal"

//  //9 Create a variable called bill and assign it the result of 10.25 + 3.99 + 7.15 (don't perform the calculation yourself, let JavaScript do it!). Next, create a variable called tip and assign it the result of multiplying bill by a 15% tip rate. Finally, add the bill and tip together and store it into a variable called total.
// // Print the total to the JavaScript console.
// // Hint: 15% in decimal form is written as 0.15_._
// // TIP: To print out the total with a dollar sign ( $ ) use string concatenation. To round total up by two decimal points use the toFixed() method. To use toFixed() pass it the number of decimal points you want to use. For example, if total equals 3.9860, then total.toFixed(2) would return 3.99.
// // Your Code:
// //10 Use your variables and string concatenation to create your own awesome message and store it in an awesomeMessage variable. Finally, print your awesome message to the JavaScript console.
// // Your Code:
//  //11 Create 2 variables one called big and one called small. Set the strings to each: "I am Big like a elepant!" "I am Small like a mouse!". Use string methods to make the 
// //'small' variable lowercase and the 'big' variable capital.
// //console.log out the results
// // Your Code:
var Big="I am Big like a elepant!"
var small="I am Small like a mouse!"
alert(Big + " " + small)
